# Comparative Analysis of Hybrid Optimization Algorithms and Proposal of Novel QWhale and SARSA Whale Approaches
In recent years, hybrid optimization algorithms have gained significant attention due to their ability to solve complex optimization problems efficiently. By combining the strengths of different algorithms, hybrid approaches often yield better performance compared to their individual counterparts. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of popular hybrid algorithms, including Genetic PSO and Genetic Whale, and introduce two novel algorithms: QWhale and SARSA Whale. Our proposed algorithms integrate reinforcement learning techniques with the Whale Optimization Algorithm to enhance task scheduling and energy optimization in cloud computing environments.
