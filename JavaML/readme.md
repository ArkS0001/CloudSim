# To work with machine Learning in Java, you'll need several libraries and tools that provide functionalities for data manipulation, model development, evaluation, and deployment. Here's a list of the main requirements for machine learning in Java:

    Java Development Kit (JDK): Install the JDK to compile and run Java programs. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK, an open-source implementation of the Java Platform.

    Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose an IDE to write, debug, and manage your Java code efficiently. Popular choices include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans.
