Algorithm Q-Whale

    1. Initialize Q(s, a) arbitrarily
    
    2. Repeat for each episode:
        a. Initialize state s
        
        b. Repeat for each step of the episode:
            i. Choose action a from state s using policy derived from Q (e.g., ϵ-greedy)
            
            ii. Take action a, observe reward r and next state s_{t+1}
            
            iii. Update Q-value:
                Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + α [r + γ max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q(s, a)]
            
            iv. Set state s to s_{t+1}
        
        c. Until state s is terminal
    
    3. Schedule cloudlets using the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA):
    
        a. Create a WOA scheduler object.
        
        b. Pass cloudlets and VMs to the scheduler.
        
        c. Execute the scheduling algorithm using WOA:
        
            i. Initialize the whale population and parameters.
            
            ii. Calculate the fitness of each whale.
            
            iii. Update the position of each whale:
            
                - If the whale is near the prey:
                    Update the whale's position towards the prey.
                
                - If the whale is searching for prey:
                    Perform a random search based on a spiral position update.
            
            iv. Evaluate the new positions and update the best solution found.
            
            v. Repeat until the stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum iterations or convergence).
    
    4. Output the scheduled cloudlets with optimized VM allocation.

Explanation:

    Q-Learning Initialization:
        Q-values Q(s,a)Q(s,a) are initialized arbitrarily.

    Episode Loop:
        For each episode, the state ss is initialized.
        Actions are chosen using a policy (like ϵϵ-greedy) based on the current Q-values.
        The Q-values are updated based on the observed reward rr and the maximum Q-value for the next state st+1st+1​.

    WOA Scheduler:
        After the Q-learning phase, cloudlets are scheduled using the Whale Optimization Algorithm.
        WOA simulates the social behavior of humpback whales to perform optimization.
        The whales' positions represent potential solutions (VM allocations), and their fitness is evaluated.
        Whales update their positions based on their proximity to the prey or perform random searches.
        The process repeats until an optimal or satisfactory solution is found.

This combination leverages the Q-learning algorithm to learn and improve decision-making, while WOA efficiently schedules tasks in a cloud environment to optimize resource utilization and energy consumption.

Sure! Here's the pseudo code for the SARSA-Whale (SARSA combined with Whale Optimization Algorithm) algorithm:

        An action aa is chosen using a policy (like ϵϵ-greedy) based on the current Q-values.
        Actions and states are updated iteratively, with Q-values updated based on the observed reward rr and the Q-value of the next state-action pair (st+1,a′)(st+1​,a′).
