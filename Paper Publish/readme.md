A consumption of 25,000 watt-seconds (or joules) represents a relatively small amount of energy. To give you an idea, let's convert this to more common units and compare it to the energy consumption of various devices.
Conversion:

1 watt-second (Ws) = 1 joule (J)
1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 3,600,000 joules (J)

So, 25,000 watt-seconds = 25,000 joules.
Comparisons:
Household Devices:

    LED Light Bulb:
        A typical LED bulb uses about 10 watts.
        25,000 joules / 10 watts = 2,500 seconds = ~41.67 minutes of operation.

    Smartphone Charging:
        Charging a smartphone fully typically consumes around 18,000 joules (or 5 watt-hours).
        25,000 joules could charge a smartphone fully and have some energy left over.

    Laptop:
        A typical laptop consumes around 50 watts when in use.
        25,000 joules / 50 watts = 500 seconds = ~8.33 minutes of operation.

    Microwave Oven:
        A typical microwave oven uses about 1,000 watts (1 kW).
        25,000 joules / 1,000 watts = 25 seconds of operation.

Other Examples:

    Electric Kettle:
        Consumes around 2,000 watts (2 kW).
        25,000 joules / 2,000 watts = 12.5 seconds of operation.

    Hair Dryer:
        Consumes around 1,500 watts (1.5 kW).
        25,000 joules / 1,500 watts = ~16.67 seconds of operation.

Summary:

25,000 joules is a modest amount of energy. It can power:

    An LED light bulb for about 41.67 minutes.
    Fully charge a smartphone.
    Run a laptop for about 8.33 minutes.
    Operate a microwave oven for 25 seconds.
    Boil water in an electric kettle for 12.5 seconds.
    Run a hair dryer for about 16.67 seconds.

This energy amount is small for heavy-duty appliances but can be significant for low-power devices or brief high-power operations.
