# Pseudo-code for quantum-inspired VM allocation using Qiskit

# Step 1: Define the VM allocation problem
# - Define objective function, constraints, and variables

# Step 2: Map problem to quantum representation
# - Encode problem variables as qubits
# - Define quantum gates/circuits representing the objective function and constraints

# Step 3: Choose quantum optimization algorithm
# - Select a quantum-inspired algorithm (e.g., Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm)

# Step 4: Implement classical pre- and post-processing
# - Prepare problem input
# - Interpret quantum results
# - Refine/optimize solutions

# Step 5: Integration with cloud infrastructure
# - Develop interfaces for communication with cloud management platform
# - Exchange data and instructions between quantum algorithm and cloud system

# Example Qiskit code for quantum-inspired VM allocation
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, transpile, assemble
from qiskit.aqua.algorithms import QAOA
from qiskit.optimization.algorithms import MinimumEigenOptimizer

# Define VM allocation problem and encode into Qiskit format

# Define quantum circuit representing the problem

# Choose quantum-inspired algorithm (e.g., QAOA)

# Define classical optimizer for post-processing

# Run quantum algorithm
quantum_instance = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
qaoa = QAOA(optimizer)
optimizer = MinimumEigenOptimizer(qaoa)
result = optimizer.solve(problem)

# Process and interpret quantum results
