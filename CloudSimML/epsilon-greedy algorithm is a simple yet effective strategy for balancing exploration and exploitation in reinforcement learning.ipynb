The method randomly chooses an action with probability ε and selects the action with the highest Q-value otherwise. Adjusting the value of ε allows you to control the trade-off between exploration and exploitation."

    "The epsilon-greedy algorithm is a simple yet effective strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Exploration vs. Exploitation: In reinforcement learning, agents often face the dilemma of whether to explore new actions (exploration) or exploit the current best-known action (exploitation). Exploration allows the agent to discover potentially better actions, while exploitation exploits the current knowledge to maximize rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Epsilon: Epsilon (ε) is a parameter between 0 and 1 that represents the probability of exploration. A value of ε indicates the probability that the agent will choose a random action (explore), while 1-ε represents the probability of choosing the action with the highest estimated value (exploit).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Greedy Action Selection: In the epsilon-greedy algorithm, the agent selects the action with the highest estimated value (greedy action) with probability 1-ε. This is the exploitation step, where the agent chooses the action that it believes will yield the highest reward based on its current knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Random Action Selection: With probability ε, the agent selects a random action from the action space. This is the exploration step, where the agent explores new actions to gather more information about their rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Balancing Exploration and Exploitation: By adjusting the value of ε, the agent can balance exploration and exploitation. A higher value of ε encourages more exploration, while a lower value of ε favors exploitation."
