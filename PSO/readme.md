 particle swarm optimization (PSO)[1] is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formula over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.

     for each particle i = 1, ..., S do
         Initialize the particle's position with a uniformly distributed random vector: xi ~ U(blo, bup)
         Initialize the particle's best known position to its initial position: pi ← xi
         if f(pi) < f(g) then
             update the swarm's best known position: g ← pi
         Initialize the particle's velocity: vi ~ U(-|bup-blo|, |bup-blo|)
     while a termination criterion is not met do:
         for each particle i = 1, ..., S do
             for each dimension d = 1, ..., n do
                 Pick random numbers: rp, rg ~ U(0,1)
                 Update the particle's velocity: vi,d ← w vi,d + φp rp (pi,d-xi,d) + φg rg (gd-xi,d)
             Update the particle's position: xi ← xi + vi
             if f(xi) < f(pi) then
                 Update the particle's best known position: pi ← xi
                 if f(pi) < f(g) then
                     Update the swarm's best known position: g ← pi
